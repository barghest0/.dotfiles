NAME
----
picom-inspect - easily test your picom rules

SYNOPSIS
--------

OPTIONS
-------
*picom-inspect* accept the exact same set of options as *picom*. Naturally, most of those options will not be relevant.

These are some of the options you might find useful (See *picom*(1) for descriptions of what they do):

*--config*, *--log-level*, *--log-file*, all the options related to rules.

NOTES
-----
*picom-inspect* is prototype right now. If you find any bug, for example, if rules are matched differently compared to *picom*, please submit bug reports to:
